# Rust Programming Language Book Study Project

This repository contains my work as I progress through [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book. This is an attempt to learn Rust in a more systematic manner, and to showcase my learning progress.

## Contents

The repository is divided into directories that follow the structure of the book:

- [Chapter 1 - Getting Started](./ch01/)
- [Chapter 2 - Programming a Guessing Game](./ch02/)
- [Chapter 3 - Common Programming Concepts](./ch03/)
- [Chapter 4 - Understanding Ownership](./ch04/)
- [Chapter 5 - Using Structs to Structure Related Data](./ch05/)
- ...

Each directory will contain the code snippets and exercises related to that chapter.

## Running the Code

To run any specific piece of code, navigate into the directory containing the desired chapter and use the Rust's package manager, Cargo, to run the code, example below:

```bash
cd ch01/guessing_game
cargo run
```
